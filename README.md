This is how I assign the ticket to the correct Agent/Department.

This is where I would locate any changes or comments made within the ticket. This basically is a way to see what all has happened so far between departments/teams, agents and end users.

Once the ticket is completed in its entirety, I would then select 'Resolved'. In the instance that there is no more correspondence from the end user as far as the issue being resolved, we would then select 'Closed'. Usually the 'Closed' option would be if the team has decided to move on from the ticket without a resolution.
